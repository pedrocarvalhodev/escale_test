## Escale test

### Part 1 - Price prediction

In order to implement a predictive analysis we choose two features, number of reviews (continuous) and room type (categorical) to apply some data cleaning and extract features.

Then we ran a tree classifier to get an estimate of the predictive capability of each feature.

Finally we give an example of a prediction of a listing of a Private room com 1 review.

Much else could have been done to extend this analysis like:

1. Getting more features from the data set

1. Doing a K-fold cross validation to estimate the accuracy of the predictive model

1. Doing a REST API with the model to simplify deployment

### Part 2 - SQL

Two SQL queries are submitted as an answer to each question
